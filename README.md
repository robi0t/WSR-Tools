# WSR-Tools
Wanna make your desktop look better - or hide windows activation? With this tool you can do that with just a click of a button
It can hide the shortcut arrows, make your taskbar fully transparent and hide windows activation


How does it work?
The only thing it does is to change registry keys and values!
If you wonder why you need to run the program as administrator for some things to work, thats because to change registry keys in local machine requires the program to run as admin

[bug] when removing shortcut arrows it says that you need to run as admin even if you run it as admin, but it still works
